* STARTED Brownian Tree builder
This is a common lisp program to visualize Brownian Trees and Random Walk trails with a lot of parameters to search for a visually interesting and appealing image.

A part of the image creation program is written as a separate SVG module, whose capabilities are limited to the requirements of the current project.

Few sample brownian-tree images.

** TODO Features
Few sample brownian-trails images.
look at trails-*-svgz images in root folder. gzipped svg image has a lot of variables so it might load the cpu up.
Try writing the path data to a file and rendering it into svg with javascript or other language with more svg support.

Bugs:
+ [todo] some thing weird going on with path background.
+ [fixed after using format with ~{ ~} directives] path initialize-instance must not be that nightmare. need to make it more streamlined, or break it into fewer parts if memory insufficient. It might be better to used advanced pretty printing of format.
