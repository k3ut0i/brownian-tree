* Brownian Tree
A program to generate a brownian tree
** Problem Statement

** writing the program.
*** visualization
visualizing brownian walks worked really well in svg format because they are just a collection of line segments. but brownian tree is a collection of slightly touching particles so the particle must be a circle with just enough radius so it looks touched with it's neighbours.
a few points to consider.
+ _What does the tree look like, if the particles are square shaped?_
+ or different polygon shaped?
+ if a particle can have more than 8 neighbours?
*** TODO testing
Complete test suites for _svg_ _brownian-trails_ and _brownian-tree_ packages.
Adding new features and debugging the whole project becomes a hassle. When adding a new feature to svg package, add a corresponding test to test-suite and it's taken care off. Jumping between packages takes a lot of time to debug.
