* Brownian Motion
[[https://travis-ci.org/k3ut0i/brownian-tree.svg?branch=master]]
Some simple visualizations of brownian motion.

Creating brownian trees is a computationally intensive task which takes a long time for large images. This is more of a prototype implementation. A more efficient implementation with video visuals of growth is in progress.

Few sample brownian-tree images.

** Brownian Trails
Simple connected brownian walks.

** Additional Documentation
For additional information look at [[https://k3ut0i.github.io/brownian-tree][github pages]] website.

** TODO Features
Try writing the path data to a file and rendering it into svg with javascript or other language with more svg support.

Bugs:
+ [todo] some thing weird going on with path background.
